# List of my portfolio projects.

- name: Pattern Recognition in Satellite Data
  date: May 2013 – January 2014
  extra_classes: tall
  description: |
    To investigate the characteristics of tropical rainfall near coasts developed the first of its kind OpenCV based pattern recognition technique. The algorithm performs Canny-Edge detection in satellite data to separate raining contours. It then consideres different image segment moments to identify rainfall patterns that are associated with coastal land-see interaction.

    The algorithm and the results of the its application to *CMORPH* [satellite data](http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/janowiak/cmorph_description.html) have been published in an article in Journal of Climate.

- name: Tracking of Servere Weather Events
  date: March 2018 – present
  extra_classes: tall
  description: |
    My work in the Centre of [Excellence of Climate Extremes](http://climateextremes.org.au/research-programs/extreme-rainfall/) focuses on the investigation of extreme rainfall events. To study the life cycles of high impact weather I am part of a team of researchers who are developing an algorithm that is able to track rainfall data of various kinds.

    The algorithm considers phase correlations to predict cell movement and is able to handle splitting and merging of different storm systems. In the team it is my responsibility to add various statistics and make the algorithm work with various datasets like satellite rainfall retrievals and high resolution model output and radar data.

- name: Machine Learning for Rainfall Extremes
  date: March 2018 – present
  extra_classes: tall
  description: |
    To gain a deeper understanding and also to improve the predictive skill of rainfall extremes in the Tropics is project aims at applying state of the art Machine Learning algorithms like support vector classifier or convolutional neuronal networks to investigate and predict the occurrence of extreme rainfall events based on large-scale precursor.

    The different algorithmic approaches (supervised and unsupervised) will be the corner-stone for a new generation of modelling approaches of tropical convection in global numerical weather prediction and climate models.

- name: A Stochastic Multicloud Model
  date: October 2015 - August 2016
  extra_classes: tall
  description: |
    In the project I developed a *coastal* version of a Stochastic Multi Cloud Multi Could model. This stochastic spin-flip model calculates transition probabilities with help of a conditional Markov Chain. The results of this project have been published in Journal of Advances in Modelling Earth Systems.

    The new modelling approach can help to improve the representation of tropical convection, a major source of climate projection uncertainties, in global numerical weather prediction and climate models.

- name: A Sea-Breeze Algorithm for Global Models
  date: March 2017 - February 2018
  extra_classes: tall
  description: |
    During my final year at Monash University I designed and implemented a decision algorithm that determines the presence of local sea-breeze circulation into the latests version of the UK Met-Office's global numerical weather forecasting model.

    While the ideas encapsulated in this algorithm are straightforward to implement the challenging part was the implementation of the parallel computing paradigm numerical models make use of in the typical in super computing environments. This first of its kind sea-breeze model is currently applied by the UK-Met Office and NASA's Global Modelling and Assimilation Office.

- name: Optimizing Weather Forecast Output with Observations
  date: October 2014 - present
  extra_classes: tall
  description: |
    The aim of the project is to improve the output of numerical weather prediction (NWP) by applying an optimisation algorithm (3D variational analysis). The variational analysis nudges NWP model output to atmospheric observations from satellites, radio sondes and radars while constraining budgets conservation of various atmospheric variables.

    The output of this optimisatoin process can be used to initialise high resolution cloud resolving models and large-eddy simulations.
